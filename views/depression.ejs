                                    Most people experience stress and anxiety from time to time. Stress is any demand placed on your brain or physical body. 
                                    People can report feeling stressed when multiple competing demands are placed on them. The feeling of being stressed can be triggered by an event that makes you feel frustrated or nervous. Anxiety is a feeling of fear, worry, or unease. 
                                    It can be a reaction to stress, or it can occur in people who are unable to identify significant Stresses in their life.

                               <li>
                                  Stress and anxiety are not always bad. In the short term, they can help you overcome a challenge or dangerous situation. 
                                  Examples of everyday stress and anxiety include worrying about finding a job, feeling nervous before a big test, or being 
                                  embarrassed in certain social situations. 
                                  If we did not experience some anxiety we might not be motivated to do things that we need to do (for instance, studying for that big test!).

                               <li>
                                  However, if stress and anxiety begin interfering with your daily life, it may indicate a more serious issue. 
                                  If you are avoiding situations due to irrational fears, 
                                  constantly worrying, or experiencing severe anxiety about a traumatic event weeks after it happened, it may be time to seek help.

                                      Anxiety Disorder treatment in Ayurveda takes a comprehensive view of an individual's physical, emotional and spiritual conditions.
                                       These attributes have an effect on prana vata, a subsidiary of vata dosha which become aggravated with worry, anxiety and depression. 
                                       Prana vata weakens the nervous system and triggers mental imbalance. It also weakens the neuro-hormonal system and nerve impulses.
                                        Ayurvedic treatment of anxiety disorder would involve curbing aggravated prana vata and increasing sattva guna,
                                       which envisages a stable and peaceful mind through self-realization and self-control, and appropriate changes in diet and lifestyle.

                                        These are expressions of excess vata in manovah stotasa i.e. in mind . Mind is credited with a 
                                        number of positive mental and emotional capacities like creativity, joy, intuition, expansiveness, clairvoyance, and deep spiritual understanding. However, when aggravated vata accumulates in the channel of the mind, it tends to cause constrictionâwhich can lead to fear, anxiety, contraction, and even loneliness. We will start by exploring how these imbalances occur in the first place, but the purpose of this article is to offer practical 
                                        guidance on how to support a return to balance so that we can reclaim health and vitality throughout the mental and emotional spheres.

                                      <b>	Breathing exercises:</b> Mind has a very close relation with breathing.
                                       A person has short and shallow breathing when anxious or stressed and has deep breathing when relaxed and happy. 
                                       Next time you become stressed, watch your breathing. Try to slow it down. Take a relaxed position and breathe deep using the abdomen muscles.
                                        Let the diaphragm expand while breathing in, and contract while breathing out.
                                       This will immediately relax you and reduce anxiety attacks. Exercise, meditation, 
                                       relaxation techniques and Yoga postures are also recommended.
