In men, hair often begins to recede from the forehead in a line that resembles the letter M. Women typically retain the hairline on the forehead but have a broadening of the part in their hair.

This type of hair loss usually affects just the scalp, but it sometimes also occurs in beards or eyebrows. In some cases, your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out.

                              <b>Sudden loosening of hair : </b> A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning and not bald patches.  
                            </li><br>

Extract the pulp from aloe vera leaf or stalk and rub into your hair. Keep massaging in circular motions. Be sure your hair is already washed before you do this. Then leave it for about 15 minutes, and then rinse with cold water. Repeat this thrice a weak.

Amla is highly rich in Vitamin C, it provides strength to the hair follicles, and thereby prevents hair fall. Boil the dried amla with coconut oil till the oil becomes black. Let it cool down and then massage your hair with this oil. Leave it for 20 minutes and then shampoo your hair as usual. Repeat this twice a week.

							   <b> Other Facts & Information :</b>
						   </span>
						   <ol>
							   <li>
								   <b>Hair Loss / Hair Fall :</b>
								   <ul>
									   <li>
										   The normal cycle of hair growth lasts for 2 to 6 years and each hair grows approximately one centimeter
										   (less than half an inch) per month during this phase. About 90 percent of the hair on your scalp is
										   growing at any one time. About 10 percent of the hair on your scalp, at any one time, is in a resting
										   phase. After 2 to 3 months, the resting hair falls out and new hair starts to grow in its place.
									   </li>

									   <li>
										   Both men and women tend to lose hair thickness and amount as they age. Inherited or “pattern
										   baldness” affects many more men than women. About 25% of men begin to bald by the time they are 30
										   years old, and about two-thirds are either bald or have a balding pattern by age 60.
									   </li>

									   <li>
										   Male-pattern baldness is the most common cause of hair loss in men. Men who have this type of hair loss
										   usually have inherited the trait. Men who start losing their hair at an early age tend to develop more
										   extensive baldness. In male-pattern baldness, hair loss typically results in a receding hair line and
										   baldness on the top of the head.
									   </li>

									   <li>
										   Women may develop female-pattern baldness. In this form of hair loss, the hair can become thin over the
										   entire scalp.
									   </li>
									   
								   </ul>
							   </li>
							   <br>
								   <li>
									   <b>Causes :</b><br>
									   The following describes some of the many things that cause hair loss:
									   <ul>
										   <li>
											  <b> Hair disorders</b>
												<ol>
													<li>
														Hereditary thinning or baldness (also called androgenetic alopecian)
													</li>
													<li>
														Alopecia areata
													</li>

													<li>
														Cicatricial (scarring) alopecia
													</li>

													<li>
														Underlying medical condition: Hair loss can be the first sign of a disease.
													</li>

													<li>
														Illness: Significant hair loss can occur after an illness.
													</li>

													<li>
														Ringworm of the scalp
													</li>

													<li>
														Trichotillomania
													</li>

													<li>
														Hormones and stress
													</li>
													
												</ol>
										   </li>


										   <li>
											   <b> Dieting and poor nutrition</b>
											   <ol>
												   <li>
													   Due to excessive Weight loss
												   </li>
												   <li>
													   Vitamin A
												   </li>

												   <li>
													   Low Protein
												   </li>

												   <li>
													   Less Iron
												   </li>

												   <li>
													   Eating disorder
												   </li>

												 

											   </ol>
										   </li>




										   <li>
											   <b> Hair Care</b>
											   <ol>
												   <li>
													   Products: Frequent bleaching or permanents can cause the hair to break. Regular or improper use
													   of dyes, gels, relaxers, and hair sprays also can cause hair breakage.
												   </li>
												   <li>
													   Blow dryers, flat irons, and other devices: Frequent use of a blow dryer tends to damage hair. The
													   high heat from a blow dryer can boil the water in the hair shaft leaving the hair brittle and prone to

													   breakage.Hairpins, clips, and rubber bands: When used to hold hair tightly, hairpins, clips, and
													   rubber bands can break hair.
												   </li>

												  



											   </ol>
										   </li>


										   <li>
											   <b> Improper washing, drying, and combing</b>
											   <ol>
												   <li>
													   Too much shampooing, combing, or brushing (100 strokes or more a day).
												   </li>
												   <li>
													   Rubbing wet hair dry with a towel.
												   </li>

												   <li>
													   Brushing or combing wet hair (especially people who are Asian or Caucasian).
												   </li>

												   <li>
													   For many people, hair is more elastic when wet. This means it breaks off more easily than dry hair.
													   When hair breakage occurs, the hair appears shaggy or too thin. For people who are of African
													   descent, their hair is not more elastic when wet.
												   </li>

												 


											   </ol>
										   </li>
										   
									   </ul>
								   </li>
								   <br>

									   <li>

										   <b>Ayurveda Management :</b>
										   <ul>
											   <li>
												   Increased hair fall in ayurveda is termed as khalitya and is classified under shiroroga.
												   Romakupagata / keshamulagata vitiated pitta (bhrajaka pitta) along with vitiated vata leads to dis-
												   lodgement or withering of the hair from the hair roots. Further to this, vitiated sleshma / kapha along
												   with rakta will cover and causes obstruction to the hair root, which results in no further hair growth from
												   that place.
											   </li>

											   <li>
												   Khalitya is primarily a Pitta predominant tridoshajanya vyadhi (all three doshas vitiated disease). But
												   based on the predominance of dosha, is divided into following types.
											   </li>
										   </ul>
